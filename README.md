# Hyzx OJ Spider Website Project
## Designed By bey„ÄÅxjz and jack

If u r our developers,Please upload ur file after refreshing it,thanks:)

**This website helps u to find the basic data on the [Hyzx online Judge](http://114.55.172.240:180/)  and we use Python Requests to get the data from the server.**

**Regarding that the server of Hyzx oj may close soon,we've crawled data from the site and what you see is the profile of 2023/3/24,  If u want to see the lastest data and the site still exists,u can go to [there](https://github.com/SwedishDoveCooker/Hyzx_OJ_Family_Bucket) to get the spider code which name will be "OJ_User_Database.py" or "OJ_User_Folder.py"**

**To run the website,u need to u install requests and Flask,After installation,click the Main.py and wait the marcle to happen,All the html and css code r written by myself so it would't be so beautiful as u guys think:D.**

**Thank u for your support<3**
